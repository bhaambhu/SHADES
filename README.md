# SHADES: Combat Militia

A top down shooter game I made for the android platform. The game was an instant hit with over 1 million downloads and an average rating of 4.5/5 stars on google play store.

This game is not open-source yet but I plan to make it.

## Why I Made This Project

// Add the why

## Tech

Unity3D, C#, Blender, GIMP, Google Play Services
## Features

### Multiplayer 
The game supports Online Multiplayer and Local Multiplayer (through WiFi Hotspot).

Both of these technologies have many differences, for local multiplayer has less latency and packet losses than online mutlplayer.

The game supports three multiplayer modes - Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, and Capture the Flag.

### Character Customizer
because the game is top down the character is not visible in detail during the gameplay, still the customization was added to allow players to be unique during multiplayer sessions

### Weapon Market
A vast range of weapons, with their own sounds and in-game 3D models. The weapons are the only items that could be purchased by the in-game currency Black Gold.

#### 1. Carnage

Small sized map for intence combat and enough corners.

### Stats
The game collects the player's various stats for display in the Hall of Fame section.

Also, the player earns XP points by playing and killing in different styles, which in-turn promote the rank of the player, making the player eligible of acquiring better weapons.

### Small Size
All of this - the 6 lightmapped maps, weapon models, character creation assets, pickup models, enemy models and animations, sound effects, voices, bgm, 2d Assets, libraries and code - comes in a small package of only **71MB**, achieved through various performance adjustments for low-spec mobile phones.

## Monetization

Monetization was done through ads and in-app-purchases. 

The game features an in-game currency **Black Gold** that can be used to buy different weapons. Also, winning a match gives the player some black gold - it depends on how the player killed the enemies - killing with melee, explosives, short-range, long-range, etc. all have different scores that determine the overall amount of black gold earned at the end. On completion of a match the game will sometimes show a button that could double the black gold earned in that match in exchange of the user watching an ad. The black gold could also be purchased, with in-app-purchases.

## Current State

I made this project in 2017 was loved by a lot of people

Is temporarily disabled from google play because various policies have been updated over the years and the app needs to comply to them in order to stay on the store (regarding google analytics data collection, multiplayer services, ads services, etc.) so it needs an update.

Have been really busy ever since
