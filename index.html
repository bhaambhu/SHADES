      rating of
      <b>4.5/5 stars</b> and <b>19K</b> reviews on the Google Play Store.

    <h2 id="why-i-made-this-project">Why I Made This Project</h2>
    <p>I just wanted to play this type of game with my friends, but could not find any, so I decided to make one. If you
      are a fan of the good-old shooter games we used to play on computers, you will like this.</p>

    <p>Unity3D, C#, Blender, GIMP, Google Play Services</p>
    <h2 id="features">Features</h2>
    <h3 id="enemy-ai">Enemy AI</h3>
    <p>For the player the game is top-down, but the AI behave naturally according to if they see or hear something.</p>

    <h3 id="character-customizer">Character Customizer</h3>
    <p>Since this is a top down game, the character's minute details are not much visible during the gameplay, but
      still, character customization was implemented to allow the players to be unique, especially during multiplayer
      sessions.</p>

    <h3 id="weapon-market">Weapons Market</h3>
    <p>A vast range of weapons, with their own sounds and in-game 3D models. The weapons are the only items that could
      be purchased using the in-game currency <b class="GoldText">Black Gold</b>.</p>

      <!-- <img src="assets/MainMenu-fallback.gif" /> -->
    </video>
    <h3 id="multiplayer">Multiplayer</h3>
    <p>The game supports Online Multiplayer and Local Multiplayer (through WiFi Hotspot) and three multiplayer modes -
      <b>Deathmatch</b>, <b>Team Deathmatch</b>, and <b>Capture the Flag</b>.
    </p>
    <img src="assets/MultiplayerMenu.png" class="HorizontalScreenshot" />
    <p>Both of these technologies have many differences, for local multiplayer has less latency and packet loss than
      online mutlplayer.</p>
    <p>Following video shows the <b>LAN connectivity</b> and the <b>Map and Time Voting System</b>
      through which all players can vote for their desired map and match time length.</p>

      <source src="assets/LAN.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      <!-- <img src="assets/MainMenu-fallback.gif" /> -->
    </video>
    <p>Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch are very common, below is a demonstration of a 2-player <b>Capture the Flag</b>
      match. In this game mode, the game divides the players into two teams - <b class="BlueText">Team A</b> and <b
        class="RedText">Team B</b>, the map has 3 Flags and the players have to turn each flag into their team's color
      and make them stay like that for 30 seconds to win. If round timer runs out before that, the team with majority of
      flags wins. It is most fun when it turns into pure chaos - when both teams have multiple players.</p>

    <h3 id="maps">Maps</h3>
    <p>The game had 6 maps, from small to large to very large size. The maps are beautifully lit and carefully crafted
      for
      strategic multiplayer spawning, enemy patrol paths, and pickups.</p>
    <h4 id="1-carnage">1. Carnage</h4>
    <p>Small sized map for intence combat and enough corners. It's the same map that is shown in the Enemy AI and
      Multiplayer videos above.</p>

    <p>Medium sized map for team combat in an indoor-home setting.</p>

    <h3 id="google-sign-in">Google Sign In</h3>
    <p>User can sign-in through Google Play Games, which further allows the player to <b>save progress on the cloud</b>,
      play
      <b>online multiplayer</b> and unlock <b>achievements</b>.
    </p>
    <video preload="none" controls loop muted class="HorizontalScreenshot">

    </video>
    <h3 id="stats">Stats</h3>
    <p>The game collects the player&#39;s various stats for display in the Hall of Fame section. </p>

    </video>
    <p>Also, the player earns XP points by playing and killing in different styles, which in-turn promote the rank of
      the
      player, making the player eligible of acquiring better weapons.</p>
    <h3 id="small-size">Small Size</h3>
    <p>All of this - the 6 lightmapped maps, weapon models, character creation assets, pickup models, enemy models and
      animations, sound effects, voices, bgm, 2d Assets, libraries and code - comes in a small package of only
      <strong>71MB</strong>, achieved through various performance adjustments for low-spec mobile phones.
    </p>
    <h2 id="current-state">A Thanking Note</h2>
    <p>I am endlessly thankful for the love and support this game received, especially the love I received from the
      people through this game. There have been countless positive and heart-warming reviews, comments, and e-mails by
      the players, that I love to go back to and read whenever I get a chance. My journey of life has been a <i>little
        more
        amazing</i> because of <b class="LoveText">YOU</b>.</p>
    <p>Currently, this game is disabled on the Google Play Store because it needs an update to include various things.
      One of these is to show the user a terms and conditions screen for the anonymous data collection done by the Unity
      Analytics library. Also, the multiplayer technologies that the game uses have become obsolete over the years and
      need to be changed.</p>
    <p>I started making an updated and improved version in 2019 with a different and improved multiplayer technology,
      but got really busy with my career and have been really busy ever since so it never got released.</p>
