    <h3 id="character-customizer">Character Customizer</h3>
    <p>because the game is top down the character is not visible in detail during the gameplay, still the customization
      was added to allow players to be unique during multiplayer sessions</p>

    <h3 id="weapon-market">Weapon Market</h3>
    <p>A vast range of weapons, with their own sounds and in-game 3D models. The weapons are the only items that could

    <h3 id="multiplayer">Multiplayer</h3>
    <p>The game supports Online Multiplayer and Local Multiplayer (through WiFi Hotspot). </p>
    <p>[Screenshot of multiplayer menu]</p>
    <p>Both of these technologies have many differences, for local multiplayer has less latency and packet losses than
      online mutlplayer.</p>
    <p>[Video of multiplayer gameplay]</p>
    <p>The game supports three multiplayer modes - Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, and Capture the Flag.</p>
    <p>[Video of capture the flag]</p>
    <h3 id="maps">Maps</h3>
    <p>The game had 6 maps, from small to large to very large size. The maps are beautifully lit and carefully crafted
      for
      strategic multiplayer spawning, enemy patrol paths, and pickups.</p>
    <h4 id="1-carnage">1. Carnage</h4>
    <p>Small sized map for intence combat and enough corners.</p>

    <h4 id="2-villa">2. Villa</h4>
    <p>Medium sized map for team combat in an indoor-home setting.</p>
    <p>[Video of Villa]</p>
    <h4 id="3-theater">3. Theater</h4>
    <p>Medium sized map inspired by the theater map from Rainbow Six Vegas 2.</p>

    <h3 id="google-sign-in">Google Sign In</h3>

    <h3 id="stats">Stats</h3>
    <p>The game collects the player&#39;s various stats for display in the Hall of Fame section. </p>
    <p>[Video of Stats]</p>
    <p>Also, the player earns XP points by playing and killing in different styles, which in-turn promote the rank of
      the
      player, making the player eligible of acquiring better weapons.</p>
    <p>[Video of class increase]</p>
    <h3 id="small-size">Small Size</h3>
    <p>All of this - the 6 lightmapped maps, weapon models, character creation assets, pickup models, enemy models and
      animations, sound effects, voices, bgm, 2d Assets, libraries and code - comes in a small package of only
      <strong>71MB</strong>, achieved through various performance adjustments for low-spec mobile phones.
    </p>
    <h2 id="monetization">Monetization</h2>
    <p>Monetization was done through ads and in-app-purchases. </p>
    <p>The game features an in-game currency <strong>Black Gold</strong> that can be used to buy different weapons.
      Also,
      winning a match gives the player some black gold - it depends on how the player killed the enemies - killing with
      melee, explosives, short-range, long-range, etc. all have different scores that determine the overall amount of
      black gold earned at the end. On completion of a match the game will sometimes show a button that could double the
      black gold earned in that match in exchange of the user watching an ad. The black gold could also be purchased,
      with
      in-app-purchases.</p>
    <h2 id="reviews">Reviews</h2>
    <p>Add screenshots of various reviews</p>
    <h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
    <p>The game was popular among youtubers
      A few gameplay videos I like</p>
    <h2 id="current-state">Current State</h2>
    <p>I made this project in 2017 was loved by a lot of people</p>
    <p>Is temporarily disabled from google play because various policies have been updated over the years and the app
      needs to comply to them in order to stay on the store (regarding google analytics data collection, multiplayer
      services, ads services, etc.) so it needs an update.</p>
    <p>Have been really busy ever since</p>
